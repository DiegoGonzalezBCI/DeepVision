# DeepVision
The DeepVision Project uses Python, artificial intelligence, and computer vision techniques to develop an accurate model for predicting the diopter of Paris IOLs. By analyzing optical data, the model enhances IOL selection and reduces post-operative refractive errors, improving patient outcomes.
